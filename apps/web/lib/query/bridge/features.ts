 * Feature-flags bridge registrar.
 *
 * Feature flags are set at deployment time via backend env vars and are
 * read once per SSR render + once on the client on mount. They do NOT
 * have live WS updates — the backend never pushes flag changes over the
 * WebSocket channel. There is therefore no handler to mirror from
 * lib/ws/handlers/ for this domain.
 *
 * If a future release adds a `features.updated` WS event, wire it here:
 *   ws.on("features.updated", (payload) => {
 *     qc.setQueryData(qk.features(), payload.flags);
 *   });
 *
 * For now this is intentionally a no-op registrar.
