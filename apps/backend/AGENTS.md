## Key Concepts

**Orchestrator** coordinates task execution:
- Receives task start/stop/resume requests via WebSocket
- Delegates to lifecycle manager for agent operations
- Handles event-driven state transitions via workflow engine
- Located in `internal/orchestrator/`

**Watcher Dispatch Coordinator** (`internal/orchestrator/watcher_dispatch.go`) is the single pipeline that turns a freshly-observed external issue (Linear, Jira, future) into a Kandev task. Bus subscribers for each integration forward the event to `WatcherDispatchCoordinator.Dispatch` with a per-integration `WatcherSource` implementation (`source_linear.go`, `source_jira.go`). Source methods carry the integration-specific bits (reserve dedup, build task request, attach task ID, release, auto-start params); the coordinator owns the cross-cutting pipeline (create task, decide auto-start, error/release handling). Add a new watcher = implement `WatcherSource` + register a one-line bus subscriber. Do NOT add another `createXIssueTask` mirror.

**Workflow Engine** (`internal/workflow/engine/`) provides typed state-machine evaluation:
- `Engine.HandleTrigger()` evaluates step actions for triggers (on_enter, on_turn_start, on_turn_complete, on_exit)
- `TransitionStore` interface abstracts persistence (implemented by `orchestrator.workflowStore`)
- `CallbackRegistry` maps action kinds to callbacks (plan mode, auto-start, context reset)
- First-transition-wins: multiple transition actions in one trigger, first eligible wins
- `EvaluateOnly` mode: engine evaluates without persisting, caller orchestrates on_exit → DB → on_enter
- `RequiresApproval` on actions: transitions requiring review gating are skipped
- Idempotent by `OperationID`; session-scoped data bag via `MachineState.Data`

**Agent Runtime** (`internal/agent/runtime/`) is the single seam for launching, resuming, stopping, and observing agent executions. ADR 0004 introduced this in Phase 1 of task-model-unification. The public surface is `runtime.Runtime` (`runtime.go`); a thin facade (`facade.go`) delegates to a `Backend` (satisfied by `*lifecycle.Manager`).

**Convention:** only `internal/agent/runtime/` (and code that pre-dates Phase 1 migration) may import `runtime/lifecycle` or `runtime/agentctl` directly. New consumers — workflow engine actions, cron-driven trigger handlers, future task-tier callers — should depend on `runtime.Runtime`. Existing call sites are migrated through later phases of task-model-unification.

**Lifecycle Manager** (`internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/`) manages agent instances under the runtime:
- `Manager` (`manager.go`, `manager_*.go`) - central coordinator for agent lifecycle
- `ExecutorBackend` interface (`executor_backend.go`) - abstracts execution environment (Docker, Standalone, Sprites, Remote Docker)
- `ExecutionStore` (`execution_store.go`) - thread-safe in-memory execution tracking
- `session.go` - ACP session initialization and resume
- `streams.go` - WebSocket stream connections to agentctl
- `process_runner.go` - agent process launch and management
- `profile_resolver.go` - resolves agent profiles/settings

**agentctl client** (`internal/agent/runtime/agentctl/`) is the HTTP/WS client used by the lifecycle manager to talk to a running agentctl instance. It is a runtime-tier package and should not be imported outside `internal/agent/runtime/`.

**agentctl** is an HTTP server that:
- Runs inside Docker containers or as standalone process
- Manages agent subprocess via stdin/stdout (ACP protocol)
- Exposes workspace operations (shell, git, files)
- Supports multiple concurrent instances on different ports

Standalone agentctl is launched in its own process group so terminal Ctrl+C is
handled by the backend lifecycle manager first. Do not make standalone agentctl
share the backend's foreground process group; that bypasses supervised shutdown
and can leak ACP subprocesses.

**Executor Types** (database model):
- `local_pc` - Standalone process on host
- `local_docker` - Docker container on host
- `sprites` - Sprites cloud environment
- `remote_docker`, `remote_vps`, `k8s` - Planned

**Remote SSH executor platforms:** Treat supported remote OS/arch values as an end-to-end contract. Platform probe/normalization, lifecycle support checks, agentctl helper resolution, platform default shell, SSH readiness endpoints, frontend response types, and tests must stay aligned. Preserve raw unsupported platform details in user-facing errors, but use normalized values for supported-platform matching. Keep shell defaults platform-aware: Darwin defaults to `zsh`, Linux defaults to `bash`, unless an explicit shell is saved.

## Execution Flow

```text
Client (WS) → Orchestrator → Lifecycle Manager → ExecutorBackend (container/process) → agentctl
                                                                                          ↓
Client (WS) ← Orchestrator ← Lifecycle Manager ←──── stream updates (WS) ──────── agent subprocess
```

1. Orchestrator receives `session.launch` via WS
2. Lifecycle Manager creates executor instance (container or process)
3. agentctl starts inside the instance, agent subprocess is configured and started
4. Agent events stream back via WS through the chain

**Session Resume:** `TaskSession.ACPSessionID` stored for resume; `ExecutorRunning` tracks active state; on restart `RecoverInstances()` reconnects.

**Provider Pattern:** Packages expose `Provide(cfg, log) (*impl, cleanup, error)` for DI. Returns implementation, cleanup function, and error. Cleanup called during graceful shutdown.

**Worktrees:** `internal/worktree/Manager` provides workspace isolation. Each session can have its own worktree (branch) to prevent conflicts between concurrent agents.

**Worktree file materialization:** `copy_files` (`Repository.CopyFiles`) is a comma-separated spec of repository-relative gitignored paths/doublestar globs seeded into each new worktree. Copy is the default; the exact terminal `:symlink` suffix (for example `.env.local:symlink`) creates a relative host-worktree link so source changes propagate live. Other colons stay literal (`config:dev`, `.env:`); use `::symlink` to copy a literal path ending in `:symlink`. Malformed reserved syntax is rejected at save time. Parsing and materialization live in `internal/worktree/copyfiles/` (`ParseSpecs`, `ValidateSpec`, `Copy`); duplicates and overlapping matches are first-entry-wins. `Manager.copyConfiguredFiles` runs before setup during worktree creation. Source and destination containment checks reject traversal and symlinked destination parents. Failures are non-fatal warnings. Windows link creation is best-effort. Remote executors cannot link to the host, so `Parse`/`Plan` preserve literal colon paths but turn symlink-mode entries into copied bytes delivered through `WriteEntries`.

**Executor default scripts:** Default prepare scripts are in `internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/default_scripts.go`; `internal/scriptengine/` handles placeholder resolution.

## Conventions

- Provider pattern for DI; stderr for logs, stdout for ACP only.
- Pass context through chains; event bus for cross-component comm.
- **Execution access:** Workspace-oriented handlers (files, shell, inference, ports, vscode, LSP) MUST use `GetOrEnsureExecution(ctx, sessionID)` — it recovers from backend restarts by creating executions on-demand. Only use `GetExecutionBySessionID` for operations that require a running agent process (prompt, cancel, mode).
- **Task lifecycle events:** Any code path that mutates a task row must publish via the event bus (`task.created` / `task.updated` / `task.deleted`) — either by going through `Service.CreateTask` / `UpdateTask` / `DeleteTask` / `ArchiveTask`, or by calling `publishTaskEvent` (or one of the `Publish*` helpers in `service_events.go`) directly. Walking `repository.TaskRepository` straight bypasses event publishing and breaks WS-driven UI like the All-Workflows kanban view. `HandoffService`'s cascade methods learned this the hard way — they now require a `TaskEventPublisher` wired via `SetTaskEventPublisher`. New cascade / bulk / cleanup paths must follow the same pattern.
- **Testing:** Prefer `testing/synctest` (Go 1.24+) over `time.Sleep` for time-dependent tests. Use `synctest.Test` to wrap tests with tickers or timeouts — it advances fake time instantly when all goroutines are idle. When `synctest` is not feasible (e.g., tests spawning external processes like `git`), use channel-based synchronization (`<-started`, non-blocking `select`) instead of sleep-based waits. Reserve `time.Sleep` only for integration tests that need real subprocess execution time.
  - **Test cleanup:** Register `t.Cleanup` immediately after creating resources that need teardown (adapters, `io.Pipe` writers, background goroutines) — before any `t.Fatal`/`t.Fatalf` path. Late cleanup registration leaks pipes and goroutines on early failure.
  - **Joining production goroutines in tests:** When code spawns untracked goroutines (e.g. `fireWakeup`), don't rely on arbitrary sleeps. Join via an observable side effect — e.g. block on `EventTypeComplete` from `a.updatesCh` after unblocking the fake agent. Use short timeouts (~100ms) for in-process negative assertions; reserve multi-second waits for subprocess/integration tests only.
  - **Path/security tests:** Avoid using the real filesystem root as a fixture root. Build fake absolute roots under `t.TempDir()` with `filepath.Join`; this keeps tests portable across Windows, POSIX, and privileged cloud executors.
  - **Filesystem permission tests:** Assert permission-denied behavior only after probing that the current executor enforces the permission bit change. Root-like Sprite executors may bypass `chmod` restrictions.
  - **Full test output:** For local full-suite pass/fail validation, prefer plain `go test -race ./...`. `go test -json ./...` can emit very large JSONL streams; if a wrapper or tracing tool truncates the stream mid-record, downstream JSON parsing may fail even when Go tests passed. Use JSON output mainly for CI artifacts or test-report tooling that explicitly requires it.

### Goroutine ownership and leak testing

Every long-running goroutine must have a single owner with explicit start and stop semantics:

- **Lifecycle:** the type that spawns the goroutine also exposes `Start(ctx)` / `Stop()` (or equivalent). `Start` registers on a `sync.WaitGroup`; `Stop` cancels the goroutine's context (or closes a `stopCh`) and `wg.Wait()`s for drain. Idempotent on both ends. `internal/integrations/healthpoll`, `internal/jira`, `internal/linear`, and `internal/github` pollers are the canonical shape.
- **E2E reset invariant:** `seedData`/backend are worker-scoped, so any workspace-scoped state a global poller reads (for example `github_review_watches`) must be deleted in `cmd/kandev/e2e_reset.go` before task deletion — otherwise the poller recreates rows mid-reset and later tests see duplicates. Add a `Delete...ByWorkspace` cascade when introducing a new poller-backed entity.
- **Cancellation:** the goroutine selects on `ctx.Done()` (or `stopCh`) in every long wait. Never use `time.Sleep` in a retry/backoff loop — use `time.NewTimer` inside a `select` that also watches the shutdown signal (see `lifecycle.StreamManager.sleepOrStop`).
- **Detached helpers:** event handlers and short-lived `go func()` calls in `internal/orchestrator/` and `internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/` must accept a cancellable context (or check the owning type's shutdown signal) and return promptly when it fires.
- **Leak testing:** packages that spawn goroutines add `goleak.VerifyTestMain(m)` in a per-package `TestMain`. New packages of this kind must follow suit. When a third-party background goroutine genuinely can't be drained, suppress it with `goleak.IgnoreTopFunction(...)` and leave a comment explaining why. Currently instrumented: `internal/gateway/websocket/`, `internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/`, `internal/agentctl/server/process/`, `internal/orchestrator/`, `internal/github/`, `internal/jira/`, `internal/linear/`, `internal/integrations/healthpoll/`.

## Backups

- On every SQLite boot, `persistence.Provide` reads `kandev_meta.kandev_version`. If the stored version differs from the binary version (or any user tables exist but no version is recorded), it takes a `VACUUM INTO` snapshot into `<data-dir>/backups/` before running migrations.
- Retention: 2 backups kept (newest two by mtime); older ones are pruned after the snapshot succeeds.
- Postgres: backup is skipped with a log line. Use `pg_dump` for Postgres backups.
- Boot aborts if the backup fails — the pool is closed and `Provide` returns an error.
- After all repos complete `initSchema`, `cmd/kandev/storage.go:recordSchemaVersion` writes the current binary version into `kandev_meta` (non-fatal; a failure just means the next boot will take a fresh snapshot).
- Migration logging: `db.MigrateLogger.Apply(name, stmt)` — success logs Info, "already exists" / "duplicate column name" is silently swallowed, anything else logs Warn but never returns an error (preserving the existing swallow-error contract).
- Schema replay handling: use `internal/db` helpers such as `IsDuplicateColumnError` / `IsAlreadyExistsError` instead of local error-string matching. When adding or changing startup schema code, include fresh-DB plus same-DB replay tests for SQLite; add the same env-gated Postgres replay coverage when the path supports Postgres. See `docs/decisions/0027-replayable-schema-migrations.md`.

## Schema & migrations (SQLite repository)

`initSchema()` in `internal/task/repository/sqlite/base_schema.go` runs the `init*Schema` (CREATE TABLE) steps **before** `runMigrations()`. The table-creation DDL uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so on an **existing** database it is a no-op and never adds columns to a table that is already present.

**Rule:** when you add a column to an existing table, add it **only** via an idempotent `ADD COLUMN` migration in `runMigrations()` (`base_migrations.go`), never by editing the table's `CREATE TABLE` alone. Anything that *references* that new column — an index, a backfill `UPDATE`, a partial-index predicate — must live in `runMigrations()` **after** the `ADD COLUMN`, not in the `init*Schema` DDL. Putting a `CREATE INDEX ... (new_col)` in the schema-init block crashes existing DBs with `no such column: new_col`, because schema init runs before the migration that adds the column.

You may still list the column in the `CREATE TABLE` so fresh DBs get it inline, but the migration is the source of truth for evolution and must stand alone. New columns also need: the struct field in `models/`, the DTO field + `ToAPI` in `pkg/api/v1/`, and every `CreateX`/`UpdateX`/bulk write in the repo that should set it.

## Code-quality limits

Enforced by `apps/backend/.golangci.yml` (errors on new code only):
- Functions: ≤80 lines, ≤50 statements
- Cyclomatic complexity: ≤15 · Cognitive complexity: ≤30
- Nesting depth: ≤5 · Naked returns only in functions ≤30 lines
- No duplicated blocks (≥150 tokens) · Repeated strings → constants (≥3 occurrences)

When you hit a limit, extract a helper function. Prefer composition over growing a single function.

When a PR fixup touches backend code, run the CI-style changed-file linter locally from `apps/backend` with the PR base SHA before pushing, because CI enforces changed-file complexity thresholds:

```bash
golangci-lint run ./... --new-from-rev="<base-sha>" --timeout=5m
```
