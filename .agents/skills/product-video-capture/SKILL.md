description: Record, camera-process, encode, integrate, and validate polished Kandev product films, landing-page loops, screenshots, and alternate cuts from isolated demo data. Use whenever the user asks for product videos, GIF-like feature demos, smooth cursor-follow zoom, desktop/mobile captures, recaptures, new landing media, or different framing; invoke product-demo-seeding first for new visible state.

# Product Video Capture

Produce reusable clean masters first; derive presentation from them later.

## Prerequisites And Repo Discovery

- Require Linux Xvfb, Chrome for Testing, Playwright/CDP, FFmpeg/FFprobe, a Kandev checkout with E2E fixtures, and the landing repository.
- Resolve the Kandev root with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, then verify it contains `scripts/dev-isolated` and `apps/web/e2e/`.
- Resolve the landing root from `KANDEV_LANDING_REPO` when set and verify it contains both `scripts/product-loop-camera.mjs` and `scripts/product-loop-encoder.mjs`. If the variable is unset or its path fails verification, search the available workspace and sibling checkouts for both marker files; do not select a directory by name alone.
- If discovery finds zero or multiple landing candidates, ask the user to identify the checkout. Record the resolved roots as `KANDEV_REPO` and `LANDING_REPO`, and use those variables for every command and copy operation.

## Choose Deliverable

| Request | Path |
| --- | --- |
| New feature/story | Seed with `/product-demo-seeding`, then capture desktop and mobile masters |
| Different zoom/crop/pacing | Reuse approved raw master; change camera config only |
| New poster/static image | Extract a settled pointer-free frame from approved master or recapture native screenshot |
| Longer walkthrough | Keep continuous 1x source; add a tested delivery profile instead of speed ramps |
| Actual GIF required | Derive from approved video last; retain WebM/MP4 as primary web formats |

## Pipeline

1. Resolve and verify `KANDEV_REPO` and `LANDING_REPO` as described above. Do not assume task-specific absolute paths.
2. Create a unique writable `CAPTURE_ROOT`, for example with `mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/kandev-product-capture.XXXXXX"`. Use it for every raw, proof, config, and staged delivery path.
3. Review the seed handoff and rehearse the full native desktop/mobile story once.
4. Record one continuous, unzoomed, high-resolution master per form factor. Use true physical pixels, not a padded Playwright video canvas.
5. Record semantic action timestamps, target bounds, and dense pointer/touch journeys beside the raw file. Include each intentional movement's start, intermediate samples, arrival, and visibility interval.
6. Stop recording before capturing the clean poster.
7. Inspect raw frames before post-production. Reject UI bugs, padding, double cursors, fixture text, dead waits, and unreadable states.
8. Build a smooth post camera from semantic events. Ignore micro-jitter, but keep every intentional pointer/touch journey inside the tested safe frame. Widen before long travel and ease toward the destination with the pointer.
9. Encode WebM, MP4, and WebP through landing's tested camera/encoder scripts.
10. Review fixed-fraction frames and playback on desktop, native mobile, and reduced motion.
11. Copy only approved delivery assets into the owning production media directory; keep raw/proof files outside production unless requested.

Read [capture-pipeline.md](references/capture-pipeline.md) before recording and [camera-encoding.md](references/camera-encoding.md) before conforming media.

## Non-Negotiable Capture Properties

- Fresh isolated data; no main instance, credentials, database, or production ports.
- Separate desktop and native-mobile scripts. Never crop desktop footage into a mobile deliverable.
- Raw master is one continuous take at 1x: no body transform, camera, crop, concat, speed ramp, or internal cut.
- Disable OS cursor in X11 capture; show one intentional high-contrast DOM cursor/touch treatment.
- Use real UI input and retain semantic bounds/timestamps for camera design and audit.
- Browser chrome absent; product fills the physical frame.
- Any responsive/product defect remains visible or blocks capture. Do not hide it with capture CSS.

## Camera And Delivery

Use `$LANDING_REPO/scripts/product-loop-camera.mjs` and `$LANDING_REPO/scripts/product-loop-encoder.mjs`. Their tests define current dimensions, frame rate, maximum zoom, smoothness, loop reset, codecs, and poster quality. Change those contracts test-first when the user requests a genuinely different delivery format.

Do not remove waits with cuts or speed changes. Improve the source choreography or recapture. One trim at the beginning/end is acceptable; time skips are not.

## Acceptance Gate

Follow [qa-checklist.md](references/qa-checklist.md). Do not ship until:

- raw and delivery dimensions are proven by decoded pixels, not only container metadata;
- cadence is constant and timestamps have no gaps;
- 10/25/50/75/90% frames and full playback pass visual review;
- camera motion is smooth, reaches intended depth, and uses the profile's tested loop frame: centered 1x by default, or one identical focused start/end crop for a short docs clip when it removes irrelevant chrome or fixture-only detail;
- text, menus, diffs, pointer, and touch targets remain inside frame; frame-by-frame pointer containment passes with a deliberate edge margin;
- WebM, MP4, poster, responsive source selection, lazy loading, and reduced-motion behavior pass;
- all capture processes, ports, temporary specs, and temp data are gone.

Report story, seed, form factors, raw/delivery dimensions, durations, codecs, camera profile, output sizes/hashes, visual audit, browser checks, teardown, and any unsupported or blocked surface.
