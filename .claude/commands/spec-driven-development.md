Use `.agents/skills/spec-driven-development/SKILL.md` for the full flow; the
root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` planner/worker contract applies. Keep small,
localized execution in the planner session. Delegate only substantial
independent packets or required independent gates: `qa`, `security-auditor`,
and `code-review` are exceptional, while `verify` remains the final
post-commit gate. Stop and report an unavailable required worker.
