# Task 03: Capture Text and Elements Across Previews

## Summary

Turn the injected inspector into a validated selection bridge and add one shared
desktop and phone review UI to the Browser panel and native HTML-file preview.
Users can save commented text and element captures, navigate across pages, and
restore markers without tying feedback to a mounted iframe.

## In scope

- Versioned parent/iframe commands and events with source, type, byte, route,
  and selector validation.
- Text selection and DOM element capture by mouse, touch, and keyboard,
  including frozen DOM range endpoints, containing-element HTML, selection
  rectangles, scroll position, and viewport metrics.
- A preselection outline, translucent fill, and concise tag/ID/class label that
  follows pointer hover, keyboard focus, or an active touch press.
- Bounded accessible metadata and escaped `outerHTML` snapshots.
- Browser localhost proxy eligibility plus already-proxied HTML-preview
  eligibility.
- Task-backed marker projection for a matching source and route, including
  unavailable-anchor state without mutation.
- Shared pending list, desktop menu/Popover/panel, phone Drawer, edit/delete,
  clear confirmation, mutation progress, and failure recovery.
- Localized copy in all five locales and minimum touch/overflow behavior.
- Removal of Browser-panel-local annotation ownership, Copy/Clear-only state,
  and obsolete local hook assumptions.

## Out of scope

- Screenshot rasterization and image upload.
- Source-line mapping or execution-state persistence.
- Sending directly from preview chrome.

## Acceptance

- Browser and native HTML preview create the same task-owned text and element
  payloads and retain prior-route items while navigation continues normally.
- A script-generated text selection remains fully represented by its saved
  rendered element, DOM range, and visual position after the live page changes.
- Element mode identifies the candidate before activation and removes every
  hint overlay when capture ends or the document changes.
- Parent code ignores events from any other window or invalid schema, and page
  HTML is always rendered as text in Kandev chrome.
- Desktop and phone offer equivalent capture, edit, delete, and review outcomes
  with viewport-native controls and recoverable drafts.

## ASCII UI preview

Implement [UI-01](plan.md#ui-01-desktop-preview-annotation) and
[UI-02](plan.md#ui-02-phone-preview-annotation). The phone action opens a Drawer
instead of shrinking the desktop pending panel.

```text
Desktop: [Refresh] [Annotate (3) ▾]  -> Text | Element | Screenshot | Review
Phone:   [Show code] [Annotate 3]     -> full-width bottom Drawer

Pending feedback
/products · Text “Choose a plan” · “Increase contrast”              [Edit]
/products · <button.checkout> · “Align with price”                  [Edit]

Element mode:  ┌──── button#save.primary ────┐
               │            Save             │  updates before selection
               └─────────────────────────────┘
```

## TDD sequence

1. Add failing Go injection and TypeScript bridge tests for the protocol,
   source validation, generated-text DOM ranges and coordinates, element
   metadata, candidate hint lifecycle, route changes, and marker projection;
   run both suites RED.
2. Implement the minimum bridge and shared hook until protocol tests pass.
3. Add failing rendered tests for Browser and HTML-preview entry, desktop
   Popover/panel, phone Drawer, draft preservation, keyboard focus, 44-pixel
   controls, and no overflow; run RED.
4. Implement the responsive components and localized copy, rerun GREEN, then
   remove obsolete local annotation state and refactor shared surface adapters.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/backend
go test -race ./internal/agentctl/server/api
cd ../../apps
pnpm --filter @kandev/web test -- --run lib/preview-inspect-bridge.test.ts hooks/use-preview-capture.test.ts components/task/browser-panel.test.tsx components/task/html-preview-content.test.tsx components/task/inspector components/task/mobile/mobile-preview-feedback.test.tsx
cd web
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run i18n:check
pnpm run i18n:ratchet
pnpm exec eslint lib/preview-inspect-bridge.ts hooks/use-preview-capture.ts components/task/browser-panel.tsx components/task/html-preview-content.tsx components/task/inspector components/task/mobile/mobile-preview-feedback.tsx
```

## Dependencies

- Task 01 supplies synchronized CRUD and screenshot-neutral pending rows.
- Task 02 ensures data created by this UI can be delivered through normal Send.

## Risks

- SPA navigation and iframe reloads can leave bridge listeners or markers bound
  to the previous document unless teardown is identity-scoped.
- Element events inside interactive controls must capture only in explicit mode
  and restore normal click and touch behavior immediately afterward.
- Native HTML preview must not pass an already-proxied URL through proxy
  rewriting again.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- Capture bridge, capture payloads, marker projection, responsive interaction,
  accessibility, and security sections in the system design.
- Existing Browser inspector submission and native HTML preview tests.

## Results

Implemented the versioned iframe bridge with strict source and payload
validation, full rendered text range evidence, bounded element snapshots,
route announcements, task-backed marker projection, and pointer, focus, and
touch candidate highlighting. Browser and HTML-file previews now share one
task-owned capture controller and one localized review surface: desktop uses a
Popover and coarse pointers use a touch-sized Drawer with an internal scroll
owner and safe-area clearance. The old Browser-local annotations, Copy/Clear
panel, and inspect hook were removed.

Focused evidence passed: bridge and capture-hook Vitest, Browser/HTML host and
responsive review component tests (19 tests), frontend typecheck, i18n checks,
scoped ESLint with zero warnings, JavaScript syntax validation, and the
inspector injection tests under Go's race detector. The package-wide
agentctl/API race suite still requires a network-enabled environment because
an unrelated `httptest` listener is denied by this sandbox.
