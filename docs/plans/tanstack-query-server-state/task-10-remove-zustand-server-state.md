# Task 10: Remove Zustand Server State

## Acceptance

- Old server-state Zustand fields/actions and WS handlers are removed after
  their readers have migrated.
- Remaining Zustand fields are documented as client-only or temporary indexes.
- `apps/web/AGENTS.md` accurately describes the new data flow.

## Progress

Completed cleanup sub-waves:

- **Office routing cleanup:** moved provider health, routing preview,
  workspace routing, agent route, and run attempts hook reads to TanStack Query
  only. `AgentCard` now receives routing data from query-backed page hooks
  instead of reading `office.routing.*` mirrors. Verified with focused hook
  tests, typecheck/lint, full verify, and the Docker `routing` project gate.
- **Office shell/sidebar cleanup:** moved the app sidebar primary inbox badge,
  Office navigation counters, sidebar agent/project sections, Office dashboard
  page, and Office agents page off `office.dashboard`, `office.inbox*`,
  `office.agentProfiles`, and `office.projects` store mirrors. These paths now
  read `qk.office.dashboard`, `qk.office.inbox`, `qk.office.agents`, and
  `qk.office.projects`; active workspace/sidebar/session state remains in
  Zustand.
- **Office inbox/activity bridge cleanup:** moved the Inbox page off
  `office.inboxItems`, removed the Activity page's old `useOfficeRefetch`
  subscription, and added Query bridge invalidation for task comments on
  `office.run.queued` and `office.run.processed` so comment run-status badges
  are covered without the legacy comments trigger.
- **Office meta cleanup:** moved all status/priority/role/executor/project/
  inbox/routine/skill metadata readers to `qk.office.meta()` through
  `useOfficeMetaData`, seeded the meta query during Office route bootstrap, and
  removed the unused `setMeta` Zustand action. The temporary `office.meta` field
  remains only as part of the broader Office state shape/query seed scaffold
  until the final Office slice removal wave.
- **Office bridge parity cleanup:** filled Query bridge invalidation gaps for
  task-linked project counts/details, task activity, agent summaries, agent run
  lists/details, run-driven dashboard data, approval-driven agent data, and
  agent route/routing updates. This unblocks later removal of page-level
  `useOfficeRefetch` subscriptions that were covering those surfaces.
- **Office page refetch cleanup:** removed old `useOfficeRefetch`
  subscriptions from Query-backed projects, routines, agent dashboard, agent
  layout, and agent runs surfaces. Remaining trigger consumers are confined to
  the task list/detail path until the task-store wave removes those store
  mirrors.
- **Office task list/detail cleanup:** moved task list rows/loading to the
  `usePaginatedTasks` infinite-query result, removed the task page's SSR
  `setTasks` hydration, removed task detail's `office.tasks.items` fallback,
  and made optimistic task mutations local-only. The last production
  `useOfficeRefetch` callers were removed in preparation for deleting the old
  scaffold. Verified by
  `rtk pnpm --dir apps/web test app/office/tasks/use-paginated-tasks.test.tsx hooks/use-optimistic-task-mutation.test.tsx lib/query/bridge/index.test.ts`,
  `rtk pnpm --dir apps/web typecheck`, `rtk pnpm --dir apps/web lint`, and

  passing 36 Docker tests with strict WS accounting.
- **Office task helper/scaffold cleanup:** moved project task sections, agent run
  linked task labels, and simple-pane parent/blocker task candidates to
  Query-backed reads. Removed the unused `useOfficeRefetch` hook, legacy Office
  WS handler registration/test, `office.refetchTrigger`, and the unused
  `office.tasks.items`/loading fields/actions from the Office slice. Verified by
  `rtk pnpm --dir apps/web test components/task/simple/components/blockers-picker.test.tsx hooks/use-optimistic-task-mutation.test.tsx app/office/tasks/use-paginated-tasks.test.tsx lib/query/bridge/index.test.ts lib/ws/router.test.ts lib/ws/handlers/agent-session.test.ts components/state-hydrator.test.tsx`,

  passing 43 Docker tests / 1 skipped with strict WS accounting.
- **Office simple-pane reference-data cleanup:** moved task detail chat/activity/
  session labels, assignee/project/reviewer/approver pickers, pending approval
  badges, and run-error labels from `office.agentProfiles`/`office.projects`
  store mirrors to active-workspace Office Query caches. Verified by
  `rtk pnpm --dir apps/web test components/task/simple/components/agents-multi-picker.test.tsx components/task/simple/components/blockers-picker.test.tsx components/task/simple/components/status-picker.test.tsx components/task/simple/components/priority-picker.test.tsx components/task/simple/components/approval-action-bar.test.tsx`,

  passing 30 Docker tests with strict WS accounting.
- **Final Office store cleanup:** moved agent detail/routes, project detail and
  writes, create-agent/create-project flows, routines, workspace skills, org
  chart, new-task reference selectors, Office route bootstrap, and costs boot
  data to Office Query caches. Removed Office server-state mirrors/actions for
  agents, projects, skills, routines, inbox, dashboard, activity, runs, meta,
  routing, provider health, run attempts, approvals, budgets, and costs; the
  Office Zustand slice now retains only task filter/sort/view/grouping/nesting
  UI state. Verified by
  `rtk pnpm --dir apps/web test hooks/domains/office/use-office-data.test.tsx app/office/agents/[id]/components/agent-configuration-tab.test.tsx app/office/agents/[id]/components/agent-runs-tab.test.tsx app/office/components/new-task-dialog.test.tsx app/office/workspace/org/org-tree-layout.test.ts app/office/page-client.test.tsx lib/query/seed.test.ts components/state-hydrator.test.tsx lib/query/bridge/index.test.ts components/task/simple/components/pending-approval-badge.test.tsx`,

  passing 67 Docker tests / 5 skipped with strict WS accounting.

- **System:** removed the system Zustand slice and `system-events` WS handler.
  System hooks and topbar metrics now read Query caches/options directly. The
  local `systemHealth` UI slice remains.
- **GitHub:** removed server-backed GitHub Zustand fields and the old GitHub WS
  handler. Query now owns status, task/workspace PRs, task CI options, watches,
  action presets, and rate-limit bridge updates. Local-only
  `pendingPrUrlByTaskId` and `prFeedbackCache` remain in Zustand.
- **GitLab:** removed the GitLab Zustand slice entirely. Status, stats,
  workspace/task MRs, review watches, issue watches, and action presets now read
  and mutate TanStack Query caches directly. `/gitlab` and GitLab settings use
  `useGitLabStatus` instead of direct status fetch effects.
- **Settings leaf lists:** converted prompts, secrets, sprites,
  notification providers, available agents, agent discovery, and editors hooks
  to Query-only readers. Prompts, secrets, editor mutations, agent refreshes,
  profile status panels, and prompt previews now patch/read Query caches instead
  of these Zustand mirrors.
- **Settings catalog/bootstrap:** converted executors, settings agents, derived
  agent profiles, install jobs, settings route bootstrap, settings layout, and
  session boot preload to Query seed/query reads. Settings agent and executor
  write paths now patch `qk.settings.*` caches directly through small sync
  helpers. Removed the old `agents`, `executors`, and `executor-profiles` WS
  handlers after their store readers/writers were gone. The settings Zustand
  slice now contains only `userSettings`.
- **Workspace/kanban direct-fetch cleanup:** added a workflow-step Query key and
  query option, moved the shared `useWorkflowSteps` hook, task-create workflow
  step effect, and automations config workflow-step picker to Query, and made
  `workflow.step.*` bridge events invalidate the workflow-step cache. Removed
  unused workspace metadata maps (`repositories` loaded/loading flags,
  repository branch loaded/loading/fetchedAt/fetchError flags, and repository
  script loaded/loading flags) from the Zustand slice, boot payloads, SSR
  session state, and old writer actions. The actual workspace, workflow,
  `kanban`, and `kanbanMulti` entity mirrors remain
  because mounted UI readers still use them as migration fallbacks. The mobile
  task switcher workspace-change path now fetches workflows and the first
  workflow snapshot through Query options instead of direct API imports. The
  task-detail route's active-task switch path now reads `taskQueryOptions`
  instead of running a component-owned `fetchTask` effect. Command-panel task
  search now reads `workspaceTasksQueryOptions` instead of importing
  `listTasksByWorkspace` directly, preserving active-task filtering and
  archived-last search ordering. Archive/delete dialog subtask counts now
  fetch through `queryClient.fetchQuery(subtaskCountQueryOptions(...))` while
  keeping the existing no-stale-count-on-reopen behavior.
- **Session dead-code cleanup:** removed production-unused `clearTaskPlan` and
  `clearQueueStatus` Zustand actions and their action-only tests, and removed
  the legacy no-op `task.plan.reverted` registration from the old `task-plans`
  WS handler. The Query bridge remains the owner for `task.plan.reverted`.
  Session/chat/plan/queue mirrors remain because mounted readers still use
  them.
- **Queue mirror cleanup:** moved `useQueue` to read/write
  `qk.session.queue` directly, with Query-cache optimistic removal and
  mutation-local loading state. Removed the old queue Zustand state/actions,
  default-state/root-store declarations, action-only queue tests, and the
  duplicate `message.queue.status_changed` registration from the old
  `agent-session` WS handler. Queue status WS updates now flow through the
  Query bridge only.
- **Plan context cleanup:** moved the `@Plan` context preview and passthrough
  composer plan expansion to Query-only reads. `LazyPlanPreview` no longer
  requires `StateProvider` or mirrors fetched plans into `taskPlans`; passthrough
  message composition reads `taskPlanQueryOptions` cache before fetching and no
  longer consults `state.taskPlans` for plan context content. The main plan
  panel hook and old `task-plans` WS handler remain because they still own
  plan editing/seen-state behavior.
- **Session todos/prompt usage cleanup:** moved `useSessionTodoItems` to the
  `qk.sessionRuntime.todos` Query cache only and removed the old
  `session.todos_updated` and `session.prompt_usage` Zustand WS handlers,
  state fields, mutators, default/root-store declarations, and boot seed paths.
  Todo and prompt usage WS updates now flow through the Query bridge only.
- **Agent capabilities/poll mode cleanup:** moved the task-list debug poll badge
  to the `qk.sessionRuntime.pollMode` Query cache only and removed the unused
  auth-methods indicator plus its orphaned frontend authenticate helper. Removed
  the old `session.agent_capabilities` and `session.poll_mode_changed` Zustand
  WS handlers, state fields, mutators, default/root-store declarations, and boot
  seed paths. These runtime WS updates now flow through the Query bridge only.
- **Improve Kandev/workflow cleanup:** moved the Improve Kandev bootstrap
  follow-up fetches for workflow steps and workspace repositories through the
  shared Query option factories, while keeping the temporary repository store
  sync for existing task-create readers. Removed the old `workflow.*` and
  `workflow.step.*` Zustand WS handler registration and deleted the legacy
  workflow handler/test file; workflow cache invalidation now flows through the
  Query bridge only. `kanban.update` and `task.*` legacy handlers remain because
  mounted kanban/task readers and task-delete cleanup side effects still depend
  on them.
- **Session runtime dead-plumbing cleanup:** removed production-unused
  `pendingModel`, `sessionRuntime.agents`, and the legacy `terminal.output`
  buffer/action/WS branch from Zustand and store hydration/re-export plumbing.
  The active `session.shell.output`, `session.process.output`, and
  `session.process.status` terminal flows remain. Backend protocol types and
  bridge audit skip metadata for `terminal.output` remain because the protocol
  still defines that stream event, but it no longer writes frontend store state.
- **Session mode cleanup:** moved the session mode selector to Query-only live
  mode data, retaining its existing session snapshot/profile fallback before any
  live mode event arrives. Removed the old `sessionMode` Zustand state/actions,
  boot seed/store plumbing, and legacy `session.mode_changed` WS handler.
  Session mode changes now update `qk.sessionRuntime.mode` through the Query
  bridge only; the `setSessionMode` API remains the user action for changing
  mode.
- **Repository scripts cleanup:** moved `useRepositoryScripts` to Query-only
  data and removed the old `repositoryScripts` Zustand state/actions,
  AppState/default-state plumbing, and store re-exports. SSR task data still
  carries repository scripts as a query-seed-only boot shape, and settings
  repository script saves now update `qk.workspaces.repositoryScripts(repoId)`
  directly instead of clearing a store mirror.
- **Task-plan revision cleanup:** moved task-plan revision list/content reads to
  TanStack Query only and removed the old `revisionsByTaskId`,
  `revisionsLoadingByTaskId`, `revisionsLoadedByTaskId`,
  `revisionContentCache`, and revision mutator actions from the session slice.
  The legacy `task.plan.revision.created` WS handler was removed; the Query
  bridge patches the revisions list and invalidates the individual revision
  detail cache. The main task-plan mirror remains for plan editing,
  last-seen/indicator, and layout auto-open behavior.
- **Available commands cleanup:** moved inline slash commands, TipTap slash
  suggestions, chat-panel agent command data, and empty-turn command
  recognition to Query-only reads. Removed the old `availableCommands`
  Zustand state/actions and legacy `session.available_commands` WS handler.
  E2E command seeding now writes directly to
  `qk.sessionRuntime.availableCommands(sessionId)`. Empty-turn local notices
  are preserved across API refetch snapshots so Query invalidation cannot drop
  the synthetic hint message. The mobile E2E page object now scopes chat editor
  and send-button locators to the visible `session-chat` panel instead of
  relying on page-wide TipTap DOM order.
- **Repository branches cleanup:** moved `useBranches` to Query-only reads and
  removed the old `repositoryBranches` Zustand state/action, root-store/default
  state declarations, hydration, overrides, and re-export plumbing. Row-level
  branch lists now cold-load through the workspace branch query so
  provider-backed URL repositories still list branches when re-picked from the
  workspace dropdown. Manual refresh forces the repository
  `?refresh=true` endpoint and copies the result into the active workspace
  branch cache. Stale task-create comments and `apps/web/AGENTS.md` were
  updated so the docs no longer describe a removed branch store fallback.
- **Workspace repositories cleanup:** moved workspace repository list reads to
  TanStack Query cache only and removed the old `repositories` Zustand
  state/action, root-store/default-state declarations, hydration, overrides,
  and re-export plumbing. Boot/route repository lists are now query-seed-only
  data. Shared repository lookup hooks read all workspace repository query
  caches, and repository-heavy UI surfaces (task-create, mobile task switcher,
  recent switcher, kanban cards, changes/review panels, quick chat, dockview
  repository scripts, and sidebar filters) now read Query cache instead of the
  workspace slice.
- **Workflow list cleanup:** moved workspace workflow list reads to TanStack
  Query cache only and removed `workflows.items`, `setWorkflows`, and
  `reorderWorkflowItems` from the kanban slice/root store. Boot and route
  workflow lists now seed `qk.workflows.all(workspaceId, { includeHidden:
true })` through `workflowLists.itemsByWorkspaceId`, while
  `workflows.activeId` remains in Zustand as UI/navigation state. Kanban
  workflow selection, move targets, swimlane ordering, task-create workflow
  resolution, settings workflow editing, task mentions, integration watch
  dialogs, recent/mobile task switchers, and route hydration now read workflow
  lists from Query cache. Swimlane workflow drag sorting now optimistically
  reorders workflow query caches before calling the backend reorder API.
- **All-workflow snapshot/loading cleanup:** moved all-workflow board/sidebar
  snapshot reads and loading state to workflow snapshot Query caches. The
  Kanban board now passes Query-owned snapshots to swimlanes, multi-select
  logic, and the bulk toolbar; `useWorkspaceSidebarTasks` consumes Query
  snapshots without the old active single-workflow store fallback. Removed the
  old `kanbanMulti.isLoading`, `setKanbanMultiLoading`, `updateMultiTask`, and
  `removeMultiTask` store surface. `kanbanMulti.snapshots`,
  `setWorkflowSnapshot`, and `clearKanbanMulti` remain temporary write-through
  compatibility for legacy direct readers and WS handlers outside this
  sub-slice.
- **Task detail lookup cleanup:** moved `useTask` and `useTaskById` to
  Query-only task-detail reads and removed their active `kanban.tasks` /
  `kanbanMulti.snapshots` fallback. Sender task badges now resolve live titles
  from `qk.tasks.detail(taskId)` and retain the snapshotted metadata fallback
  when no task detail is cached/fetched.
- **Task removal cleanup:** moved `useTaskRemoval` removal/switch source data
  to workflow snapshot Query caches and introduced a shared
  `workflow-snapshot-cache` helper used by both task removal and multi-select
  bulk operations. `useTaskRemoval` no longer reads `kanbanMulti.snapshots` or
  calls `setWorkflowSnapshot`; it keeps only a temporary active `kanban.tasks`
  cleanup write for remaining single-workflow mirror readers. Last-task removal
  now redirects home through the SPA router instead of `window.location.href`,
  preserving strict WS accounting hooks during E2E teardown.
- **Active workflow snapshot cleanup:** moved the active board read path to
  workflow snapshot Query caches. `useWorkflowSnapshot` no longer falls back to
  `state.kanban`; `useTasks`, `useKanbanData`, `KanbanBoard`, and
  `KanbanWithPreview` now derive active tasks, steps, loading, multi-select,
  and preview task lookup from `qk.workflows.snapshot(...)` /
  `useAllWorkflowSnapshots`. Boot and route hydration now seed workflow
  snapshot query keys from existing `kanban` / `kanbanMulti` payload shapes so
  first paint remains populated while the legacy mirror still exists. The
  Query bridge now patches workflow snapshot and task-detail
  `primary_session_state` on `session.state_changed`, replacing the active
  board's dependency on the old `syncKanbanPrimarySessionState` store merge.
- **Active board writer cleanup:** moved the live board optimistic writers to
  workflow snapshot Query caches. Dialog create/edit success now patches
  `qk.tasks.detail(...)` and `qk.workflows.snapshot(task.workflow_id)`;
  delete/archive success removes tasks from cached workflow snapshots; swimlane
  drag/drop uses the Query snapshot with rollback on failed moves. The unused
  legacy `useDragAndDrop` hook was deleted after moving its shared
  `MoveTaskError` type to `lib/kanban`, and the orphaned
  `swimlane-graph-content` file was removed after import scans confirmed it was
  dead. The used Kanban and Pipeline views now share the Query-backed
  `useSwimlaneMove` path.
- **Sidebar filter options cleanup:** moved workflow, workflow-step, and
  executor-type filter option lists to workflow snapshot Query caches via
  `useAllWorkflowSnapshots(activeWorkspaceId)`. The sidebar filter hook no
  longer reads `kanbanMulti.snapshots`; Zustand remains only for the active
  workspace UI selection in this path.
- **Task mention metadata cleanup:** moved `@task` mention menu construction
  and referenced-task prompt context expansion to workflow snapshot Query
  caches. `buildTaskMentionItems`, `buildTaskMentionsContext`, the TipTap chat
  input, normal chat send, and passthrough composer no longer read
  `state.kanban` / `kanbanMulti.snapshots` for task title/workflow/step
  metadata. The normal send path still writes created chat messages to the
  local session store for missed-frame resilience.
- **Recent task switcher cleanup:** moved recent task switcher live metadata
  resolution to workflow snapshot Query caches. The hook no longer reads active
  `state.kanban` tasks/steps/workflow id or `kanbanMulti.snapshots`; display
  titles, workflow names, step titles, task states, repositories, and session
  status are derived from Query snapshots plus the remaining session/client
  stores.
- **Mobile session switcher cleanup:** moved the mobile task switcher sheet's
  step data, task selection/archive/delete metadata lookups, task-created cache
  upsert, and workspace-switch snapshot fetch to workflow snapshot Query
  caches. The sheet hook no longer reads or writes active `state.kanban` or
  `kanbanMulti.snapshots`; it keeps only client UI/session stores for active
  task/session selection and pending message/session badges.
- **Mobile repo/session metadata cleanup:** moved mobile repo count/rows, repo
  pill active repo name, session primary marker, repo display name, and
  base-branch-by-repo readers to task-detail and repository Query caches. These
  mobile metadata paths no longer read active `state.kanban.tasks` or
  `kanbanMulti.snapshots`; legacy stores can be empty while cached task detail
  drives repository/session labels.
- **Desktop sidebar/removal cleanup:** moved active sidebar creation defaults,
  subtask parent labels, task-section workflow selection, sidebar archive/delete
  metadata, sidebar task selection metadata, sidebar move-to-step optimistic
  writes, and `useTaskRemoval` next-task/removal logic to Query-owned workflow
  snapshot and task-detail data. These paths no longer read or write active
  `state.kanban` / `kanbanMulti.snapshots`; the sidebar still keeps client UI
  state in Zustand.
- **Task-page/session chrome cleanup:** moved task-detail route metadata,
  workflow steps, session panel step resolution, header/sidebar new-task
  context, session primary markers, base-branch repository lookup, subtask
  defaults, plan-mode layout detection, and changes-panel multi-repo labels to
  Query caches. These task-page/session chrome paths no longer synthesize or
  override task metadata from active `state.kanban.tasks` /
  `kanbanMulti.snapshots`.
- **Board/command/dialog utility cleanup:** moved card context-menu workflow
  move targets, command-panel step filtering/badges, and session command
  subtask parent titles to Query caches. `useKanbanCardMoveTargets` reads
  workflow snapshot query cache, command-panel step derivation uses stable
  Query-owned snapshot data, and `SessionCommands` reads `useTaskById` instead
  of active `kanban.tasks`.
- **Task-create/card/GitHub indicator/board-grid cleanup:** moved session-mode
  task-create repository naming, task-create workflow snapshot defaults, kanban
  card subtask parent badges, GitHub PR indicator step tooltips, and board-grid
  loading decisions to Query-owned task detail, repository, workflow list, and
  workflow snapshot caches. These UI readers no longer depend on active
  `state.kanban` or `kanbanMulti.snapshots` mirrors being populated.
- **Legacy kanban WS mirror cleanup:** removed the old `kanban.update` Zustand
  handler registration and handler/test file. The remaining `task.*` WS handler
  now keeps only client-side side effects: active primary-session adoption,
  deleted-task local storage cleanup, sidebar preference cleanup, and context
  file cleanup. `session.state_changed` no longer patches active
  `state.kanban` / `kanbanMulti.snapshots`, and `workspace.deleted` no longer
  clears the legacy kanban mirror. Query bridge handlers now own workflow
  snapshot invalidation/patching for these server-state events.
- **Final kanban store compatibility cleanup:** removed the top-level
  `kanban` / `kanbanMulti` store fields, `setWorkflowSnapshot`, route/boot
  seed compatibility shapes, active snapshot fallback paths, stale test
  fixtures, and dead active-board fallback helpers. Route readiness now checks
  Query snapshot hydration directly, SSR/boot seeds use
  `workflowSnapshots.itemsByWorkflowId`, `mergeInitialState` allowlists known
  store fields, and stale scans find no production references to the removed
  store API.
- **Feature flags and session worktrees cleanup:** moved feature flag reads and
  session worktree indexes to TanStack Query. `useFeature` now reads
  `qk.features()`, `useSessionWorktrees` reads
  `qk.sessionRuntime.worktrees(sessionId)`, boot/route payloads seed those query
  keys, and `session.agentctl_ready` patches the worktree query cache through
  the bridge. Removed the old feature slice, `worktrees` /
  `sessionWorktreesBySessionId` store fields/actions, the unused
  `use-worktree` hook, and the legacy agent-session worktree store writer.
- **Final retained-state audit:** corrected `apps/web/AGENTS.md`, removed stale
  bridge-audit wording, reclassified `run.event.appended` as component-local,
  and confirmed final stale scans have no production matches for removed
  feature/worktree, kanban/workspace/repository, office, settings/integration,
  queue, plan revision, command, todo, prompt usage, capability, poll-mode, or
  legacy handler store APIs. Remaining scan hits are documented retained state
  or non-Zustand false positives such as route-local `state.repositories`, the
  public `setSessionMode` API, retained `sessionModels`, and client-only
  `kanbanPreviewedTaskId`.

Retained Zustand inventory:

- Client navigation/UI state: `tasks.activeTaskId`, `tasks.activeSessionId`,
  `workflows.activeId`, `workspaces.activeId`, preview/sidebar/mobile/dialog
  state, persisted user settings, and local preferences.
- Live session indexes: `messages`, `turns`, `taskSessions`,
  `taskSessionsByTask`, `taskPlans`, `sessionAgentctl`, and
  `activeModel.bySessionId` remain for stream ordering, missed-frame recovery,
  plan editing/seen-state UI, active-session chrome, model UI, and local panel
  behavior while Query owns server snapshots and invalidation.
- Runtime stream indexes: `shell`, `processes`, `gitStatus`,
  `sessionCommits`, `contextWindow`, `prepareProgress`, `sessionModels`,
  `userShells`, and `environmentIdBySessionId` remain for high-frequency
  terminal/process/git/context/model updates and environment-scoped cleanup.
- Server-backed persisted preference state: `userSettings` remains in Zustand
  for local preference persistence and UI merge behavior; server-state settings
  consumers are seeded through `qk.settings.user()`.
- Local integration/client indexes: GitHub `pendingPrUrlByTaskId` and
  `prFeedbackCache` remain local-only; `office.tasks.filters`,
  `office.tasks.viewMode`, `office.tasks.sortField`, `office.tasks.sortDir`,
  `office.tasks.groupBy`, and `office.tasks.nestingEnabled` remain local UI
  state.
