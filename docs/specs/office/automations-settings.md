# Automations in Settings

## Why

Users want to schedule an agent to run a prompt on a cron (or on a GitHub PR event, or on a webhook) without first navigating to per-workspace settings, picking the right workspace, then drilling down into a workflow. They also want two execution flavors: **tracked work** that shows up on the kanban as a real task (current default), and **fire-and-forget runs** whose output is just informational — not kanban clutter.

The Automations feature, originating in PR #406, gives kandev a standalone trigger-based subsystem (cron, GitHub PR events, webhooks) that turns triggers into Tasks. This spec extends it with two changes: (1) a per-automation `execution_mode` choice between **task** (existing behavior) and **run** (new — creates an ephemeral kanban-hidden task that surfaces only through the AutomationRun row), and (2) a flat `/settings/automations` entry point that drops the per-workspace nesting from the sidebar.

## What

- Every automation has an `execution_mode` field — `task` (default) or `run`. The choice is per-automation, editable in the editor.
- Every automation has an optional `repository_id` field. When set, scheduled and webhook firings pin the task to that repository on its default branch. When empty, falls back to the workspace's first repository (legacy behavior). `github_pr` triggers always use the PR's own repository and ignore `repository_id`.
- The editor's repository picker matches the task-creation dialog's UX: lists both registered workspace repositories AND filesystem-discovered repositories under the workspace's roots. Picking a discovered repo registers it with the workspace at automation-save time (one round-trip via `createRepositoryAction`), then stores the resulting id on the automation. After the first save, the selection is promoted from `discovered` to `registered` so subsequent edits don't try to re-register.
- `execution_mode = task`: trigger fires → a normal kanban task is created (current PR #406 behavior). Task is visible on the kanban, commentable, reviewable, and has full lifecycle.
- `execution_mode = run`: trigger fires → an ephemeral task is created (`is_ephemeral = true`, `origin = "automation_run"`) so the existing session pipeline still launches an agent. The kanban hides ephemeral tasks. The AutomationRun row is the surfaced artifact; the linked task is plumbing only.
- Run-mode automations **auto-start** their agent regardless of the workflow step's `auto_start_agent` setting — the user never opens the task to drag it, so the trigger MUST be the start signal.
- The sidebar exposes a single top-level **Automations** entry pointing at `/settings/automations`. The per-workspace `Automations` sub-link is removed (PR #406 added it; this spec drops it).
- `/settings/automations` is a client route that branches on the workspace list already loaded into the SPA (from the boot payload / store) — it does **not** fetch the workspace list on load:
  - 0 workspaces → empty state with "Create workspace" CTA.
  - 1 workspace → redirect to `/settings/workspace/<id>/automations`.
  - 2+ workspaces → workspace picker (grid of cards, click to enter).
- The automations table shows the execution mode as a badge column ("Task" / "Run") so the user can scan which automations clutter the kanban and which don't.

## Data model

Builds on PR #406's `internal/automation/` schema. Two columns added (folded into the canonical `CREATE TABLE` since PR #406 itself introduces the `automations` table — no in-branch migrations are needed):

```
automations.execution_mode TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'task'   -- 'task' | 'run'
automations.repository_id  TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''       -- optional FK-by-id to repositories
```

The `tasks.is_ephemeral` and `tasks.origin` columns already exist (used by quick-chat). Run-mode automations set both at task-create time. New task origin constant `TaskOriginAutomationRun = "automation_run"` lives in `internal/task/models/models.go`.

`automation_runs.task_id` continues to reference the created task for both modes. Run mode just means that task is hidden.

## API surface

PR #406's WS-based API gets two new fields — `execution_mode` and `repository_id` — on:

- `automation.create` payload (input)
- `automation.update` payload (input)
- `automation.get` / `automation.list` responses (output)

No new endpoints. No HTTP routes change. Sidebar deep-links to `/settings/automations` (flat).

## State machine

Automation lifecycle unchanged. Run-mode and task-mode share the trigger → AutomationRun pipeline. The only branching is in `orchestrator/event_handlers_automation.go::handleAutomationTriggered`:

```
trigger fires
  → resolve repository
  → CreateReviewTask(IsEphemeral=mode==run, Origin=automation_run)
  → record AutomationRun (status=task_created, task_id set)
  → associate PR if github_pr trigger
  → if mode==run OR step.auto_start_agent: StartTask
  → for mode==run: agent terminal turn outcome marks AutomationRun succeeded/failed and tears down the execution/worktree
```

## Permissions

Inherits PR #406's model (no per-action authorization gates). The flat `/settings/automations` page is reachable by anyone with workspace-list access, since it only lists workspaces and links into the per-workspace UI.

## Failure modes

| Dependency / invariant                                                    | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No workspaces are loaded into the SPA store when the flat page renders    | Page renders the empty state (treating "none loaded" as "no workspaces"). The page reads the store and never fetches on load, so there is no per-render fetch that can fail or loop. |
| Run-mode automation's task starts but agent fails                         | AutomationRun transitions from `task_created` to `failed`; the row surfaces the failure instead of remaining "Running".                                                              |
| Run-mode automation's agent completes its turn successfully               | AutomationRun transitions from `task_created` to `succeeded`; the agent execution and ephemeral worktree are torn down.                                                              |
| Run-mode automation's turn is cancelled by the user                       | AutomationRun transitions from `task_created` to `failed` with a cancellation error; the hidden session is marked `CANCELLED` and the agent execution is torn down.                  |
| User manually drags a run-mode task on the kanban                         | Cannot happen — ephemeral tasks are hidden from the kanban. The "auto-start" rule fires once at trigger time; no manual recovery path.                                               |
| Existing automation upgraded from pre-execution_mode version              | Migration sets `execution_mode = 'task'` for all existing rows. UI shows them with "Task" badge.                                                                                     |
| User edits `execution_mode` from `task` to `run` on an enabled automation | Next firing uses the new mode. In-flight runs are unaffected.                                                                                                                        |

## Persistence guarantees

`automations.execution_mode` and `tasks.is_ephemeral` survive restart. Run-mode AutomationRuns and their hidden tasks persist normally. The kanban filter on `is_ephemeral` is applied at query time, not at write time — so re-marking a task non-ephemeral via direct DB update would reveal it.

## Scenarios

- **GIVEN** a user creates an automation with `execution_mode = "task"` and a cron trigger, **WHEN** the cron fires, **THEN** a normal kanban task appears with the rendered title; the user can click it, drag it, comment on it.
- **GIVEN** a user creates an automation with `execution_mode = "run"` and a cron trigger, **WHEN** the cron fires, **THEN** an ephemeral task is created (not visible on the kanban), the agent starts automatically, and the AutomationRun row in the automation's history shows the result.
- **GIVEN** a run-mode automation agent finishes a turn with `stop_reason = "end_turn"`, **WHEN** the complete event is handled, **THEN** the AutomationRun row is marked `succeeded` and the agent execution is stopped instead of waiting for process exit.
- **GIVEN** a user opens `/settings/automations` in an install with one workspace, **WHEN** the page loads, **THEN** the browser redirects to `/settings/workspace/<id>/automations`.
- **GIVEN** a user opens `/settings/automations` in an install with three workspaces, **WHEN** the page loads, **THEN** a workspace picker is shown; clicking one navigates to its automations.
- **GIVEN** a user opens `/settings/automations` in a fresh install with zero workspaces, **WHEN** the page loads, **THEN** an empty-state card explains "create a workspace first" with a CTA.
- **GIVEN** a user opens `/settings/automations` in a multi-workspace install, **WHEN** the page loads, **THEN** it renders the picker from the already-loaded workspace list and issues **no** additional `GET /api/v1/workspaces` request on load (guards against the render/refetch loop that a server-style `await listWorkspaces()` in the page body caused after the SPA migration).
- **GIVEN** a user toggles an existing task-mode automation to run mode in the editor, **WHEN** the next trigger fires, **THEN** the resulting task is hidden from the kanban; previously-created tasks (from task-mode firings) remain visible.
- **GIVEN** a run-mode automation triggered by a GitHub PR event, **WHEN** the trigger fires, **THEN** the PR is associated with the ephemeral task via `AssociatePRWithTask` exactly as in task mode.
- **GIVEN** a scheduled automation with `repository_id` set to a specific repo, **WHEN** the cron fires, **THEN** the resulting task is pinned to that repo's default branch — regardless of whether the workspace has other repositories.
- **GIVEN** a scheduled automation with `repository_id = ""` in a multi-repo workspace, **WHEN** the cron fires, **THEN** the task uses the workspace's first repository (legacy fallback) and a warning is logged.
- **GIVEN** an automation with `repository_id` set and a `github_pr` trigger, **WHEN** a PR event fires, **THEN** the task uses the PR's own repository, not the configured `repository_id` — the editor disables the picker for PR triggers with a hint.
- **GIVEN** a user picks a discovered (not-yet-registered) repository in the editor and clicks Save, **WHEN** the save flow runs, **THEN** the discovered repo is registered with the workspace first (`createRepositoryAction`), its new id is written onto the automation, and the picker selection is promoted to `registered` so re-saving doesn't duplicate the registration.
- **GIVEN** an upgrade from a pre-execution_mode kandev version, **WHEN** the user opens the editor for an existing automation, **THEN** the execution-mode selector defaults to "Task" (preserving previous behavior).

## Out of scope

- **AutomationRun-as-true-session-owner** (instead of ephemeral task). The cleaner model — make `task_sessions.task_id` nullable, add `task_sessions.automation_run_id`, route run-mode bypassing tasks entirely — was considered and explicitly deferred to a future PR. It touches ~50+ files in the orchestrator + session pipeline + WS layer + frontend state, which is out of scope here. The ephemeral-task path is the pragmatic shim.
- **Agent-type primary picker.** PR #406's editor still picks an `agent_profile_id` (a fully configured profile), not a raw agent type (`claude` / `codex` / `opencode`). Switching to agent-type-primary requires plumbing changes in the orchestrator (which expects a profile id). Deferred.
- **Auto-provisioned default workspace.** When no workspaces exist, the flat page shows a CTA; it does not auto-create one. Most installs already have a workspace (workspace setup is part of onboarding), so the CTA is sufficient for now.
- **Cross-workspace automation listing** on the flat page. Multi-workspace installs see a picker, not a merged list. Merging would require a new list-all endpoint and a workspace column in the table.
- A standalone AutomationRun detail page (showing session output for run-mode firings). Run-mode automations currently link to the linked task's detail page; since the task is hidden from the kanban it's reachable only by direct URL.
- Webhook execution-mode override (e.g. webhook payload setting `execution_mode` per call). The execution mode is automation-level, not per-firing.
