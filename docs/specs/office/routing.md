# Office Provider Routing

Provider routing lets a workspace map abstract model tiers (Frontier / Balanced / Economy) to concrete CLI providers, configure an ordered fallback chain, and degrade providers automatically when they hit auth / quota / rate / outage limits. This spec describes the routing contract: tier mapping, fallback chain, provider health checks, the degraded state lifecycle, and the wake-reason tier policy.

## Why

Office agents need a predictable way to choose between CLI providers and model strengths without manually cloning every agent profile for every provider. Users also need controlled fallback when a provider hits subscription or rate limits, while keeping important agents pinned to a specific provider when desired.

## What

### Enablement and tiering

- Provider routing is an advanced workspace setting and is disabled by default.
- When provider routing is disabled, Office uses the concrete CLI profile chosen for the agent exactly as it does today.
- Every Office agent has an effective model tier even when routing is disabled.
- Workspace settings provide the default model tier, initially `balanced`.
- Agents inherit the workspace default tier unless the user sets an agent-specific override.

### Provider order and tier mapping

- Workspace settings can define a global provider order, for example `claude -> codex -> opencode`.
- Workspace settings can map each provider to three model tiers: `frontier`, `balanced`, and `economy`.
- Tier labels are user-facing as Frontier, Balanced, and Economy.
- Example tier mappings include Claude `frontier=opus`, `balanced=sonnet`, `economy=haiku`, and Codex `frontier=gpt-5.5 high`, `balanced=gpt-5.4`, `economy=gpt-5.3 mini`.
- Each Office agent can inherit workspace routing or override it.
- Agent overrides can choose a model tier and provider order independently; an override order with only `claude` never falls back to `codex` or `opencode`.
- Users configure provider tier mappings explicitly; the UI does not silently apply recommended presets.
- Onboarding lets the user choose one concrete CLI profile for the coordinator and one source profile for each workspace tier: Frontier, Balanced, and Economy. Office expands those source profiles into provider/model tier mappings so enabling routing later does not require editing every agent.
- The tier profile selectors are profile-family choices, not direct agent assignments. When the CEO creates a worker, QA, or specialist agent and assigns a tier, the agent inherits the workspace tier family selected during onboarding or later routing settings.
- Source profile IDs used to seed tier mappings are recorded as routing metadata. Deleting a profile that is still referenced by a workspace tier returns an in-use error until the mapping is changed; manually editing a tier model in routing settings clears the source-profile association for that tier.

### Run resolution

- Run launch resolves a logical Office agent to an effective provider/model only when provider routing is enabled.
- Provider adapters classify launch and runtime failures into normalized provider-routing error codes using structured signals, provider-specific message patterns, and adapter phase context.
- Unknown failures in provider-owned phases can fall back as low-confidence `unknown_provider_error` events, with raw evidence preserved for later classifier updates.

### Fallback chain

- Fallback is more conservative after the agent has started task work; post-start fallback only happens for clear provider, auth, quota, rate-limit, outage, or model-availability failures.
- Detectable provider-unavailable errors can fall back to the next configured provider, including auth failures, expired credentials, provider outages, subscription limits, quota limits, and rate limits.
- When a provider route fails again during a retry/probe, the same task immediately tries the next configured provider candidate and the failed provider route stays degraded with an increased backoff.
- If every configured provider route is unavailable, the task keeps its logical Office agent assignment and waits for provider capacity or user action instead of being reassigned.
- If at least one exhausted provider route is auto-retryable, the scheduler wakes the blocked task automatically at the earliest retry time.

### Provider health checks and degraded state

- A degraded provider route becomes temporarily ineligible for affected workspace launches until it reaches a retry time, passes a health check, succeeds on a launch probe, reconnects, or the user retries it from the UI.
- Auto-retryable provider-unavailable errors without a known reset time use exponential backoff before that provider route is retried.
- User-actionable provider blocks, such as missing credentials, expired auth, inactive subscription, provider not installed, provider not configured, or missing model-tier mapping, stay blocked until the user fixes configuration, reconnects, or manually retries.
- Provider health issues are visible in workspace settings, dashboard, inbox, and affected agent detail pages.

### Wake-reason tier policy

- Workspace settings can map specific wake reasons (heartbeat, routine_trigger, budget_alert) onto specific tiers so background work cheaps out automatically.
- The workspace policy applies to every agent in the workspace unless that agent overrides it.
- Agents can override the workspace policy with their own per-reason tier map (rare; meant for security-critical agents that need Frontier even for routine checks).
- An override map replaces the workspace map entirely - keys missing from the override fall through to the agent's normal effective tier rather than the workspace policy.
- Default workspace policy seeded at onboarding is Economy for all three reasons, mirroring the legacy cheap-profile shortcut so the out-of-the-box behaviour is unchanged when routing is enabled.
- The resolver order is: wake-reason policy (agent override > workspace policy) -> agent tier override -> workspace default tier.
- The wake-reason policy is the single surface for "use a cheaper model for low-stakes background runs"; the legacy `cheap_agent_profile_id` mechanism no longer exists.

### Surfacing

- Task and run surfaces show the logical Office agent, requested tier, resolved provider/model, and fallback state when applicable.
- Run history preserves the route decision made at launch, including provider order, selected provider/model, fallback attempts, and fallback reasons.
- Run history preserves classifier evidence for fallback decisions, including normalized code, confidence, adapter phase, classifier rule ID, exit code when available, and a short raw error excerpt.
- Agent detail and agent list surfaces show the current resolved provider/model, whether the tier and route are inherited or overridden, and whether the agent is currently degraded by provider fallback.

## Data model

Provider routing persists three things: the workspace's routing config, per-provider health rows, and per-run routing telemetry. Agent overrides ride on the existing `agent_profiles.settings` JSON blob (no new table).

### `office_workspace_routing` (per workspace)

One row per workspace. Defaulted in-code to `Enabled=false, DefaultTier=balanced, ProviderOrder=[], ProviderProfiles={}, TierPerReason={}` when the row is absent (see `internal/office/repository/sqlite/workspace_routing.go::defaultWorkspaceRouting`).

```
office_workspace_routing
  workspace_id      string  PK
  enabled           int     0|1
  default_tier      string  frontier|balanced|economy
  provider_order    text    JSON array of provider IDs
  provider_profiles text    JSON map: provider_id -> {tier_map, tier_profile_ids, mode, flags, env}
  tier_per_reason   text    JSON map: wake_reason -> tier (NOT NULL, "{}" default)
  updated_at        timestamp
```

`provider_profiles[pid].tier_map` is `{frontier, balanced, economy}` with each value either a model ID or empty string ("skip this provider for this tier"). `provider_profiles[pid].tier_profile_ids` is optional metadata with the source profile ID that authored each tier mapping; routing resolution ignores it, but profile deletion checks use it to prevent orphaned tier/profile associations. `tier_per_reason` keys are restricted to `heartbeat | routine_trigger | budget_alert` (see `routing.AllWakeReasons`); other keys are rejected by `routing.ValidateWorkspaceConfig`.

### `office_provider_health` (per workspace, per provider, per scope)

```
office_provider_health
  workspace_id   string     PK part
  provider_id    string     PK part
  scope          string     PK part: provider|tier|model
  scope_value    string     PK part: "" for provider; tier name; model id
  state          string     healthy|degraded|user_action_required
  error_code     string     normalized routingerr.Code, "" when healthy
  retry_at       timestamp  nullable; unset for user_action_required
  backoff_step   int        current step in routing.backoffSchedule
  last_failure   timestamp  nullable
  last_success   timestamp  nullable
  raw_excerpt    text       sanitized stderr/stdout snippet, nullable
  updated_at     timestamp
```

Primary key is `(workspace_id, provider_id, scope, scope_value)` so a tier-specific failure does not take the whole provider down. `ScopeFromCode` maps normalized error codes to the scope to degrade: `model_unavailable -> (model, <model>)`, `provider_not_configured` (missing tier mapping) -> `(tier, <tier>)`, every other auth/quota/rate/provider failure -> `(provider, "")`.

The resolver walks scope priority `provider -> tier -> model` and uses the first non-healthy hit. `MarkProviderDegraded` increments `backoff_step` on every degraded -> degraded transition; `MarkProviderHealthy` clears `backoff_step`, `retry_at`, and `error_code`.

### `runs` routing columns (per run)

`runs` carries the per-run routing decision and parking state. All columns are nullable / zero-valued for runs that did not go through the routing path (workspace routing disabled).

```
runs (routing additions)
  logical_provider_order     text   JSON snapshot of effective order at launch, stable across post-start fallbacks
  requested_tier             string the tier the resolver consumed (override > default)
  resolved_provider_id       string the provider that actually launched
  resolved_model             string model on the launched provider
  current_route_attempt_seq  int    monotonically bumped by IncrementRouteAttemptSeq
  route_cycle_baseline_seq   int    seq floor for the current retry cycle; attempts at or below the baseline are NOT in the exclude-set
  routing_blocked_status     string waiting_for_provider_capacity | blocked_provider_action_required
  earliest_retry_at          timestamp nullable; minimum auto-retry deadline across degraded routes
  scheduled_retry_at         timestamp mirrors earliest_retry_at while parked
```

### `office_run_route_attempts` (per run, per attempt)

One row per provider attempt inside a run. `(run_id, seq)` is the primary key. Each fallback (resolver candidate tried) appends a new row keyed by the next `current_route_attempt_seq`. Persisted by the dispatcher in `internal/office/scheduler/dispatch_routing.go`.

```
office_run_route_attempts
  run_id           string  PK part, FK -> runs.id
  seq              int     PK part
  provider_id      string
  model            string
  tier             string
  outcome          string  succeeded|failed|skipped
  error_code       string  routingerr.Code; nullable
  error_confidence string  high|medium|low; nullable
  adapter_phase    string  routingerr.Phase; nullable
  classifier_rule  string  the rule id that produced the classification
  exit_code        int     nullable
  raw_excerpt      text    sanitized stderr/stdout snippet
  reset_hint       timestamp nullable; provider-supplied retry deadline
  started_at       timestamp
  finished_at      timestamp nullable
```

### Agent overrides (`agent_profiles.settings.routing`)

No new table. `routing.AgentOverrides` is JSON-serialized under the top-level `"routing"` key of `agent_profiles.settings`. Round-tripped by `routing.ReadAgentOverrides` / `routing.WriteAgentOverrides`. Zero blob deletes the key.

```
AgentOverrides
  provider_order_source    string  "" (inherit) | "override"
  provider_order           []ProviderID
  tier_source              string  "" (inherit) | "override"
  tier                     Tier
  tier_per_reason_source   string  "" (inherit) | "override"
  tier_per_reason          map[wake_reason]Tier
```

A `*_source` value of `"override"` replaces the workspace equivalent entirely; any other value (including the empty string default) inherits. Keys missing from an override `tier_per_reason` map fall through to the agent's normal effective tier rather than the workspace policy.

## API surface

### Go interfaces

`routing.Resolver` (`internal/office/routing/resolver.go`) is the single seam the scheduler dispatcher calls to pick a candidate.

```go
type Resolver interface {
    Resolve(ctx context.Context, workspaceID string,
        agent settingsmodels.AgentProfile, opts ResolveOptions) (*Resolution, error)
}

type ResolveOptions struct {
    ExcludeProviders []ProviderID // providers already tried in this run
    Reason           string       // wake reason; consults TierPerReason
}

type Resolution struct {
    Enabled         bool             // false short-circuits to legacy launch
    RequestedTier   Tier
    ProviderOrder   []ProviderID
    Candidates      []Candidate      // ordered, exclude-set-filtered
    SkippedDegraded []SkippedCandidate
    BlockReason     BlockReason      // populated when Candidates is empty
}
```

`Candidate` carries `(ProviderID, Model, Tier, Mode, Flags, Env)` — self-describing so the launch path never reaches back into routing config.

`routingerr.ProviderProber` (`internal/agent/runtime/routingerr/probe.go`) is the optional cheap-availability check:

```go
type ProviderProber interface {
    Probe(ctx context.Context, in ProbeInput) *Error
}

// Package-level registry
func RegisterProber(providerID string, p ProviderProber)
func GetProber(providerID string) (ProviderProber, bool)
```

Probers must complete in under five seconds and MUST NOT start an agent session. Missing prober means "use the next real launch as the probe" — no default LaunchAsProbe shim exists in v1.

`routingerr.Classify(Input) *Error` is the classifier entry point used by adapters. `Input` carries `(Phase, ProviderID, ExitCode, StructuredErr, HTTPStatus, Stderr, Stdout)`; the returned `*Error` carries `(Code, Confidence, Phase, FallbackAllowed, AutoRetryable, UserAction, ClassifierRule, ExitCode, ResetHint, RawExcerpt)`. Normalized `Code` values include `auth_required`, `missing_credentials`, `subscription_required`, `quota_limited`, `rate_limited`, `provider_unavailable`, `model_unavailable`, `provider_not_configured`, `unknown_provider_error`, `agent_runtime_error`, `permission_denied_by_user`, `task_error`, `repo_error`.

### HTTP routes (workspace-level, mounted in `dashboard`)

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/workspaces/:wsId/routing` | – | `{config: WorkspaceConfig, known_providers: [ProviderID]}` |
| PUT | `/workspaces/:wsId/routing` | `WorkspaceConfig` | `204` on success, `400` with `{error, field, details[]}` on validation failure |
| POST | `/workspaces/:wsId/routing/retry` | `{provider_id}` | `{status: "probed"\|"retrying", retry_at?}` |
| GET | `/workspaces/:wsId/routing/health` | – | `{health: [ProviderHealth]}` (non-healthy rows only) |
| GET | `/workspaces/:wsId/routing/preview` | – | `{agents: [AgentRoutePreview]}` |
| GET | `/agents/:id/route` | – | `{preview, overrides, last_failure_code?, last_failure_run?}` |

The per-agent override blob is written via the existing `PATCH /agents/:id` endpoint (mounted in `internal/office/agents`): the request body's `settings` JSON round-trips the `"routing"` key. Validation runs `routing.ValidateAgentOverridesAgainstWorkspace`, which adds a cross-check that the overridden tier is mapped on at least one provider in the effective order so save-time errors surface immediately instead of at the next launch.

`PUT /workspaces/:wsId/routing` enabling routing requires (a) non-empty `provider_order`, (b) every provider in the order has a registered `ProviderProfile`, (c) every provider in the order maps `DefaultTier` to a model. Disabling routing requires no fields. Material config changes (provider order, default tier, provider profiles) trigger `ClearAllParkedRoutingForWorkspace`, which re-queues every parked run in the workspace.

### WS event types (forwarded to clients by the office WS broadcaster)

| Event type | Payload fields | When published |
|---|---|---|
| `office.provider.health_changed` | `workspace_id, provider_id, scope, scope_value, state, error_code, retry_at` | Whenever the scheduler marks a provider health row degraded / healthy / user-action |
| `office.route_attempt.appended` | `run_id, attempt` (full `RouteAttempt` shape) | After the dispatcher writes a `RouteAttempt` row |

Internal expvar metrics (`/debug/vars` in dev): `routing_route_attempts_total`, `routing_route_fallbacks_total`, `routing_route_parked_total`, `routing_provider_degraded_total`, `routing_provider_recovered_total`. Same events are also logged as structured zap entries under `routing.metric.*`.

## State machine

### Provider route lifecycle (per workspace, per provider)

- `eligible` -> `degraded` on a classified provider-unavailable error (auth, quota, rate limit, outage, subscription, model-availability).
- `degraded` -> `eligible` on any of: scheduled health check success, launch probe success, reconnect, user-triggered retry from the UI.
- `degraded` -> `degraded` (with increased backoff) on a probe / retry failure; the task using the route immediately moves to the next candidate.
- Auto-retryable degraded routes carry a `retry_at` timestamp; user-actionable degraded routes remain blocked indefinitely until the user acts.

### Task resolution outcome

- All-providers-exhausted, at least one auto-retryable: task is parked; scheduler wakes it at the earliest `retry_at`.
- All-providers-exhausted, all user-actionable: task is blocked until the user reconnects / configures / retries.
- Mixed: task is blocked, UI surfaces both the earliest automatic retry and the user actions needed.

## Permissions

Routing is a workspace-admin surface; agents themselves do not call any routing endpoints.

- Reading workspace routing (`GET /workspaces/:wsId/routing`, `/health`, `/preview`) is open to any caller authenticated to the workspace.
- Writing workspace routing (`PUT /workspaces/:wsId/routing`, `POST /retry`) is workspace-admin only. The dashboard surface assumes admin auth at the layer above; agent JWTs cannot mutate workspace settings.
- Per-agent routing overrides ride on `PATCH /agents/:id`, which the `agents` handler restricts: only the target agent itself or a CEO / admin role caller may mutate another agent's settings (see `isAdminRole` check in `internal/office/agents/handler.go`).
- The runtime action surface (`/runtime/*` in `internal/office/runtime/handler.go`) does NOT expose any routing-mutation capability; there is no `CapabilityModifyRouting` in v1. Agents that need to change tier or provider order escalate through approvals or human admins.

## Failure modes

- **Provider returns a known quota / auth / rate-limit signal**: route resolution uses the normalized error code rather than provider-specific prose. Provider goes `degraded`; task falls through to the next configured provider.
- **Provider fails before session start with an unrecognized provider-owned error**: scheduler records a low-confidence `unknown_provider_error`, preserves evidence, and tries the next configured provider.
- **Task has already started editing or running tools, provider reports an ambiguous failure**: scheduler does not fall back unless the error clearly matches a provider-unavailable class. Post-start fallback is conservative by design.
- **Provider returns a generic provider-unavailable error without a reset time**: route marked degraded with a short exponential backoff `retry_at`; same task immediately runs through the next configured provider.
- **Degraded provider reaches retry time, probe fails again**: task immediately tries the next candidate; provider route stays degraded with an increased backoff.
- **Degraded provider's scheduled health check, launch probe, reconnect, or user-triggered retry succeeds**: route returns to `eligible`; future launches can use it again.
- **All configured providers quota-limited or temporarily unavailable**: task waits for capacity and automatically retries at the earliest route retry time. Logical Office agent assignment is preserved; task is not reassigned automatically.
- **All configured providers require user action**: task is blocked until the user reconnects, configures a provider, fixes model mappings, or manually retries.
- **Provider health state changes (workspace level)**: dashboard and inbox show an actionable issue listing affected agents and routes.

## Persistence guarantees

- **Workspace routing config (`office_workspace_routing`)**: durable. Survives restart. When the row is missing, `GetWorkspaceRouting` synthesises the spec defaults in-memory and the caller may upsert later.
- **Provider health (`office_provider_health`)**: durable. `state`, `retry_at`, `backoff_step`, `last_failure`, `last_success`, and the sanitized `raw_excerpt` survive restart, so a degraded provider stays degraded until a successful probe / launch / user retry, even across crashes. Healthy rows are not persisted (they are pruned to the healthy state, and `ListProviderHealth` filters them out at the SQL layer).
- **Run routing decision**: `runs.logical_provider_order`, `requested_tier`, `resolved_provider_id`, `resolved_model`, `current_route_attempt_seq`, `route_cycle_baseline_seq`, `routing_blocked_status`, `earliest_retry_at`, `scheduled_retry_at` are durable. A parked run still re-dispatches after a restart because `scheduled_retry_at` re-enters the scheduler's eligibility filter.
- **Route attempts (`office_run_route_attempts`)**: durable. Every attempt row is written before the next candidate is tried, so post-start fallback reasoning (the exclude-set is `seq > route_cycle_baseline_seq`) survives restart.
- **Agent overrides**: durable via `agent_profiles.settings` JSON. Round-trips other settings keys untouched.
- **Backoff jitter**: deterministic-ish (±25% via the process-default rand source); not seeded across restarts. The base `backoff_step` is durable, so the schedule rung resumes from where it left off, but the exact jitter offset is reset.
- **Prober registry (`routingerr.RegisterProber`)**: process-local, in-memory only. Probers must re-register on every boot via package-init or DI wiring. There is no on-disk record of which providers have probers.
- **Provider order / tier-mapping changes that materially alter routing decisions trigger `ClearAllParkedRoutingForWorkspace`**: parked runs are re-queued and resolution runs fresh against the new config. False-positive clears (changes that could not have affected the block reason) are harmless because runs simply re-park with the latest verdict.
- **Workspace flips enabled `true -> false`**: `ClearAllParkedRoutingForWorkspace` re-queues every parked run so they unstick via the legacy non-routing dispatch path on the next scheduler tick.

See also: [`office/runtime.md`](runtime.md) for how the runtime classifies and surfaces individual errors, and the office scheduler (`internal/office/scheduler/`) for the dispatcher that consumes `Resolver.Resolve`.

## Scenarios

- **GIVEN** provider routing is disabled, **WHEN** the coordinator agent launches, **THEN** it uses the concrete profile copied during onboarding with its selected model and mode.
- **GIVEN** workspace routing is enabled with `claude -> codex -> opencode` and tier `balanced`, **WHEN** an agent without overrides launches, **THEN** it first tries the Claude balanced model and may fall back through the remaining providers on provider-limit errors.
- **GIVEN** the CEO agent overrides provider order to `claude` and tier `frontier`, **WHEN** Claude is rate-limited, **THEN** the CEO run does not try Codex or OpenCode and follows the normal failure/escalation path.
- **GIVEN** a worker agent inherits workspace routing, **WHEN** the workspace default tier changes from `frontier` to `balanced`, **THEN** future worker runs use the balanced tier without editing the worker.
- **GIVEN** routing is enabled after several agents already exist, **WHEN** those agents still inherit workspace routing, **THEN** their future runs use the workspace default tier and provider order without requiring per-agent edits.
- **GIVEN** a task run falls back from Claude to Codex because Claude is quota-limited, **WHEN** the user opens the task, run history, agent detail, or dashboard, **THEN** the UI shows the intended primary route, the actual provider/model, and the quota-limit reason.
- **GIVEN** Claude credentials expire, **WHEN** an agent with fallback providers launches, **THEN** the scheduler records the auth failure, marks Claude degraded for the workspace, and tries the next configured provider.
- **GIVEN** a provider adapter returns a known quota, auth, or rate-limit signal, **WHEN** route resolution handles the failure, **THEN** the scheduler uses the normalized error code rather than provider-specific prose.
- **GIVEN** a provider fails before session start with an unrecognized provider-owned error, **WHEN** no classifier rule matches, **THEN** the scheduler records a low-confidence `unknown_provider_error`, preserves evidence, and tries the next configured provider.
- **GIVEN** a task has already started editing or running tools, **WHEN** the provider reports an ambiguous failure, **THEN** the scheduler does not fall back unless the error clearly matches a provider-unavailable class.
- **GIVEN** a provider returns a generic provider-unavailable error without a reset time, **WHEN** the route fails, **THEN** the scheduler marks that provider route degraded, sets a short backoff retry time, and runs the same task through the next configured provider.
- **GIVEN** a degraded provider reaches its retry time, **WHEN** a health probe or task-launch probe fails again, **THEN** the task immediately tries the next candidate and the provider route receives a longer backoff.
- **GIVEN** a provider is marked degraded, **WHEN** a scheduled health check, launch probe, reconnect, or user-triggered retry succeeds, **THEN** future launches can use that provider again.
- **GIVEN** all configured providers are quota-limited or temporarily unavailable, **WHEN** a task exhausts the route list, **THEN** the task waits for provider capacity and automatically retries at the earliest route retry time.
- **GIVEN** all configured providers require user action, **WHEN** a task exhausts the route list, **THEN** the task is blocked until the user reconnects, configures a provider, fixes model mappings, or manually retries.
- **GIVEN** exhausted provider routes include both auto-retryable and user-actionable failures, **WHEN** the task is blocked, **THEN** the UI shows the earliest automatic retry and the user actions needed for the blocked routes.
- **GIVEN** a provider is unavailable for a workspace, **WHEN** the provider health state changes, **THEN** the dashboard and inbox show an actionable issue listing affected agents and routes.
- **GIVEN** onboarding creates a new workspace, **WHEN** setup completes, **THEN** provider routing is disabled but the selected Frontier / Balanced / Economy source profiles are expanded into the workspace routing seed.
- **GIVEN** an agent profile is referenced by a workspace tier, **WHEN** the user tries to delete that profile, **THEN** deletion returns an in-use error until the tier mapping is changed.
- **GIVEN** routing is enabled and the workspace's `tier_per_reason.heartbeat = economy`, **WHEN** a heartbeat run launches, **THEN** the resolver picks the Economy tier model regardless of the agent's default tier.
- **GIVEN** the security agent overrides wake-reason tiers with `heartbeat = frontier`, **WHEN** its heartbeat fires, **THEN** it uses Frontier even though the workspace policy says Economy.
- **GIVEN** a run reason has no policy (e.g. `task_assigned`), **WHEN** that run launches, **THEN** it uses the agent's effective tier as before, ignoring the wake-reason policy entirely.

## Out of scope

- Requiring every agent to be edited before provider routing can be enabled.
- Routing non-Office kanban sessions.
- Changing onboarding to require provider-routing setup.
- Shipping recommended provider/model tier presets.
- Cost optimization beyond user-selected tiers and provider order.
- Per-wake-reason policy for reasons outside `{heartbeat, routine_trigger, budget_alert}` in v1. Future work could extend the set.
