# Kubernetes Deployment Guide

This guide covers building the Kandev Docker image and deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (for building the image)
- A container registry (Docker Hub, GHCR, ECR, etc.)
- A Kubernetes cluster with `kubectl` configured
- A StorageClass that supports `ReadWriteOnce` PVCs (for SQLite persistence)

## Building the Image

The root `Dockerfile` consumes a prebuilt Linux release bundle; it does not compile the repository inside Docker. On a Linux host matching the cluster architecture, prepare the same build context used by the release workflow:

```bash
make service-bundle
rm -rf ctx
mkdir -p ctx/bundle
cp -R dist/kandev/. ctx/bundle/
cp docker-entrypoint.sh ctx/
docker build -f Dockerfile -t kandev:latest ctx
```

For cross-architecture or multi-architecture images, produce the matching `kandev-linux-x64.tar.gz` and/or `kandev-linux-arm64.tar.gz` bundles first. For each platform, extract the bundle's top-level `kandev/` directory into `ctx/bundle/`, copy `docker-entrypoint.sh` into `ctx/`, and build that context for the matching platform. A `--platform` flag alone does not cross-compile the native binaries. See the [Docker guide](./docker.md#building-from-source) for the context layout.

### Using the Pre-built Image

Kandev publishes images to GitHub Container Registry. Pull directly:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:latest
```

Or reference it in your K8s deployment:

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:latest
```

### Choosing your image: vanilla vs. universal

Kandev publishes two flavors: the default vanilla image (smallest, npm-installable agent CLIs only) and a `:universal` image (~1.4 GB) that adds language toolchains (Go, Rust, build-essential), linters, and Playwright Chromium system libs - useful when your agents work on Go/Rust/Python projects or drive headless browsers.

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:universal
```

See the [repository image guide](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev/blob/main/docs/images.md) for the full comparison, inclusion policy, and recipes for deriving your own image when you need something neither flavor includes.

## Deploying to Kubernetes

### Quick Start

```bash
# Apply all manifests
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Check status
kubectl get pods -l app=kandev
kubectl logs -l app=kandev -f
```

### What Gets Created

| Resource | File | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Deployment | `deployment.yaml` | Single-replica pod running backend + web |
| Service | `service.yaml` | ClusterIP exposing port 38429 |
| ConfigMap | `configmap.yaml` | Non-sensitive environment configuration |
| PVC | `pvc.yaml` | 10Gi persistent volume for SQLite + worktrees |
| Ingress | `ingress.yaml` | Example ingress with WebSocket support |

### Accessing the UI

**Port-forward** (quickest for testing):

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/kandev 38429:38429
# Open http://localhost:38429
```

**Ingress**: Edit `k8s/ingress.yaml` to set your domain, then apply. The ingress routes all traffic to the backend on port 38429; the Go backend serves API, WebSocket, and SPA traffic on that port.

### Custom Domain / Reverse Proxy

No extra configuration is needed. The frontend automatically uses `window.location.origin` to reach the API, which works with any domain, reverse proxy, or ingress setup.

## Installing Agent CLIs

The kandev image ships with `git`, `gh` (GitHub CLI), `node`, and `npm`, but **does not bundle the coding-agent CLIs** (`claude-code`, `codex`, `auggie`, etc.) — agent choice is per-user, and bundling all of them would bloat the image significantly.

> Looking to add tools *beyond* agent CLIs - language toolchains, build tools, internal CLIs? See the [repository image guide](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev/blob/main/docs/images.md) for the universal-image option and recipes for deriving your own image.

To install an agent inside the running pod, open **Settings → Agents** in the UI and click **Install** on the agent card under "Available to Install". The backend runs the agent's hard-coded install script (`npm install -g <pkg>`) and rescans on success.

The image sets `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=/data/.npm-global` so user-installed npm globals land on the PV and **survive pod restarts and image upgrades**. The same persistence applies if you `kubectl exec` and install manually:

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/kandev -- npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

After installing, log in with the agent's own auth (e.g. `claude login`), then click **Rescan** on the agents page.

### Persistent agent and `gh` CLI auth

The image sets `HOME=/data/home` for the `kandev` user, so every CLI that writes its auth state under `$HOME` lands on the PV and survives pod restarts and image upgrades. This includes:

- `gh` CLI — `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`
- Claude Code — `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, `~/.claude.json`
- Codex — `~/.codex/auth.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml`
- Auggie — `~/.augment/session.json`
- GitHub Copilot — `~/.copilot/...`
- OpenCode, Amp — `~/.config/<tool>/...`

So a one-time `kubectl exec -it deployment/kandev -- gh auth login` (or `claude login`, `codex login`, etc.) is enough; you do not need to redo it after `kubectl set image` or a `helm upgrade`.

> The GitHub PAT configured in **Settings → Integrations → GitHub** is stored as a secret in the SQLite DB (or your external Postgres) and has always persisted. The `HOME=/data/home` setup covers the separate `gh auth login` flow that the backend falls back to when no `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is set.

## Configuration

Kandev reads configuration via `KANDEV_`-prefixed environment variables (Viper). Put only non-sensitive values in `k8s/configmap.yaml`; inject passwords and signing keys into the Deployment from a Kubernetes Secret.

### Core Settings

See [`configuration.md`](./configuration.md) for the full reference (every backend knob and its YAML form). The tables below cover what's most commonly set in K8s manifests.

| Env Var | Required | Default | Description |
|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `KANDEV_SERVER_PORT` | No | `38429` | Server port (API + WebSocket + Web UI) |
| `KANDEV_HOME_DIR` | No | `/data` | Kandev home directory - contains `data/` (DB), `tasks/`, `worktrees/`, `repos/`, `sessions/`, and `lsp-servers/` |
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_DRIVER` | No | `sqlite` | Database driver (`sqlite` or `postgres`) |
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_PATH` | No | `$KANDEV_HOME_DIR/data/kandev.db` | SQLite database file path (override) |
| `KANDEV_NATS_URL` | No | empty | Shared NATS event bus URL. Required when multiple backend replicas must share events; empty selects a process-local in-memory bus. |
| `KANDEV_DOCKER_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Enable Docker runtime for agents (requires DinD) |
| `KANDEV_LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `KANDEV_LOGGING_FORMAT` | No | environment-selected (`json` in K8s) | Explicit format: `json` or `text`. The literal value `auto` is not accepted. |
| `KANDEV_LOGGING_OUTPUTPATH` | No | `stdout` | Log destination: `stdout`, `stderr`, or a file path (rotated when a file) |
| `KANDEV_LOGGING_MAXSIZEMB` | No | `100` | Rotate the log file when it exceeds this size (MB). File output only. |
| `KANDEV_LOGGING_MAXBACKUPS` | No | `5` | Max rotated files to retain (`0` = unlimited). File output only. |
| `KANDEV_LOGGING_MAXAGEDAYS` | No | `30` | Max age of rotated files in days (`0` = unlimited). File output only. |
| `KANDEV_LOGGING_COMPRESS` | No | `true` | Gzip rotated files. File output only. |

> **Logging in K8s:** prefer the default `stdout` so kubelet collects logs. If you set `KANDEV_LOGGING_OUTPUTPATH` to a file, the active log is created with mode `0600` (owner read/write only); any sidecar reading it must run as the same user.
>
> **Upgrading from a pre-`KANDEV_HOME_DIR` deployment?** The SQLite DB path moved from `/data/kandev.db` to `/data/data/kandev.db`, and `KANDEV_DATA_DIR` is gone — point `KANDEV_HOME_DIR` at the same volume mount (`/data`) instead. (`KANDEV_WORKTREE_BASEPATH` still works as an explicit override if you want to keep worktrees outside the home dir.) The backend auto-migrates the legacy `kandev.db` (plus any `-wal`/`-shm` files) on first boot — look for `Migrated SQLite database from pre-KANDEV_HOME_DIR location` in the pod logs. If you'd rather pin the old path, set `KANDEV_DATABASE_PATH=/data/kandev.db` in the ConfigMap.

Keep `KANDEV_DATABASE_PASSWORD`, `KANDEV_AUTH_JWTSECRET`, and `KANDEV_OFFICE_JWTSIGNINGKEY` out of ConfigMaps. Reference Secret keys from the Deployment instead:

```yaml
env:
  - name: KANDEV_DATABASE_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: kandev-secrets
        key: database-password
  - name: KANDEV_AUTH_JWTSECRET
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: kandev-secrets
        key: auth-jwt-secret
  - name: KANDEV_OFFICE_JWTSIGNINGKEY
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: kandev-secrets
        key: office-jwt-signing-key
```

### PostgreSQL Settings (when `KANDEV_DATABASE_DRIVER=postgres`)

| Env Var | Required | Default | Description |
|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_HOST` | No | `localhost` | PostgreSQL host |
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_PORT` | No | `5432` | PostgreSQL port |
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_USER` | Yes | `kandev` | Database user |
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_PASSWORD` | Usually | (empty) | Database password - required unless your Postgres allows passwordless auth |
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_DBNAME` | Yes | `kandev` | Database name |
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_SSLMODE` | No | `disable` | SSL mode (`disable`, `require`, `verify-ca`, `verify-full`) |

## Database: SQLite vs PostgreSQL

### SQLite (default)

- Zero-config, works out of the box
- Database stored at `/data/data/kandev.db` on the PV (derived from `KANDEV_HOME_DIR=/data`)
- **Single replica only** (SQLite is single-writer)
- Deployment strategy is `Recreate` to prevent concurrent writes
- Good for small teams / personal use

### PostgreSQL (recommended for production)

- Supports multiple replicas for horizontal scaling when paired with shared NATS
- Change deployment strategy to `RollingUpdate`
- Set via environment variables:

```yaml
# Non-sensitive values in configmap.yaml
KANDEV_DATABASE_DRIVER: postgres
KANDEV_DATABASE_HOST: postgres.default.svc.cluster.local
KANDEV_DATABASE_PORT: "5432"
KANDEV_DATABASE_USER: kandev
KANDEV_DATABASE_DBNAME: kandev
KANDEV_NATS_URL: nats://nats.default.svc.cluster.local:4222
```

Supply `KANDEV_DATABASE_PASSWORD` from a Secret as shown above. When using Postgres, the PVC is still needed for worktree storage but the database itself is external. An empty `KANDEV_NATS_URL` selects an isolated in-memory event bus in each process, so notifications and orchestration events do not coordinate across replicas; do not scale beyond one backend replica without shared NATS.

## Persistent Storage

The PVC at `/data` stores:

- **SQLite database** (`/data/data/kandev.db`, `/data/data/kandev.db-wal`, `/data/data/kandev.db-shm`)
- **Git worktrees** (`/data/worktrees/`), **tasks** (`/data/tasks/`), **repos** (`/data/repos/`), **sessions** (`/data/sessions/`), and **LSP servers** (`/data/lsp-servers/`)
- **User home** (`/data/home/`) — `$HOME` for the in-pod `kandev` user; holds `gh` CLI auth and agent CLI auth state (see [Persistent agent and `gh` CLI auth](#persistent-agent-and-gh-cli-auth) above)
- **npm globals** (`/data/.npm-global/`) — agent CLIs installed via `npm install -g`

The PVC uses `ReadWriteOnce` access mode. If your cluster requires a specific StorageClass, add it to `k8s/pvc.yaml`:

```yaml
spec:
  storageClassName: your-storage-class
```

## Health Checks

The deployment includes both probes on the `/health` endpoint:

- **Liveness probe**: Restarts the pod if the backend becomes unresponsive (30s interval, 3 failures)
- **Readiness probe**: Removes the pod from service during startup or issues (10s interval, 3 failures)

The CLI launcher also performs an internal health check — it waits for the backend to be healthy before starting the web server.

## Scaling

**Single replica (SQLite)**: The default configuration uses `replicas: 1` with `Recreate` strategy. This ensures only one instance writes to SQLite at a time.

**Multiple replicas (PostgreSQL + NATS)**: Switch to Postgres, configure the same `KANDEV_NATS_URL` on every replica, change the deployment strategy to `RollingUpdate`, and increase replicas:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
```

## Upgrading

Rebuild the release bundle and refresh `ctx/` using [Building the Image](#building-the-image) before running the image build below.

```bash
# Build and push new image
docker build -f Dockerfile -t your-registry.com/kandev:v1.1.0 ctx
docker push your-registry.com/kandev:v1.1.0

# Update deployment
kubectl set image deployment/kandev kandev=your-registry.com/kandev:v1.1.0

# Or edit the deployment directly
kubectl edit deployment kandev
```

SQLite migrations run automatically on startup — no manual migration step needed.

> **Upgrading across the `HOME=/data/home` change:** if you used `kubectl exec` to `gh auth login` or log in to agent CLIs on a pre-`HOME=/data/home` image, that state lived in the ephemeral `/home/kandev` and is not carried over. Log in once on the new pod and it will persist for all subsequent upgrades. If you want to keep the old state, copy it onto the PV before upgrading:
>
> ```bash
> kubectl exec deployment/kandev -- sh -c 'cp -a /home/kandev/. /data/home/ 2>/dev/null || true'
> ```

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -l app=kandev

# View logs
kubectl logs -l app=kandev -f

# Shell into the pod (if needed)
kubectl exec -it deployment/kandev -- /bin/bash

# Check PVC status
kubectl get pvc kandev-data

# Describe pod for events
kubectl describe pod -l app=kandev
```
